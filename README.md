###Currently under development!

Overview
---
This repository includes the Eagle design files (schematics and layout) for our [ADNS3080 Brekout Board][1]. The ADNS3080 is an optical
mouse sensor with a 30x30 pixel resolution, 2000--6400 fps update rate, and SPI interface.

This breakout board provides the necessary circuitry to communicate with the sensor using a microcontroller via SPI (5V).  The board uses 
.1" spacing for easy mounting on a solderless breadboard. For more info on how to use the ADNS3080 optical mouse sensor for detecting optic flow please visit:
